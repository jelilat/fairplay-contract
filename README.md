# Fairplay: No-Loss Prediction Markets

## Overview
Fairplay is a decentralized no-loss prediction market protocol where users can stake on market outcomes without risking their principal. The reward pool is generated from platform fees, which are distributed to winning participants.

## Core Components

### 1. Markets
- **Market Creation**: Anyone can create a market by specifying:
  - Question (e.g., "Will ETH price be above $3000 on Dec 31?")
  - Category (e.g., "Crypto", "Sports", "Politics")
  - End Time

### 2. Order Book System
- **Limit Orders**: Users place orders specifying:
  - Amount to stake
  - Price (in probability terms, 0-100%)
  - Position (YES/NO)
- **Matching Engine**: Orders are matched based on:
  - Price compatibility
  - Time priority (FIFO)

### 3. Fee Structure
- **Platform Fee**: 1% of each stake
- **Distribution**:
  - 80% to winning stakers
  - 10% to market creator
  - 10% to protocol

### 4. Resolution Mechanism
1. **Market End**: Trading stops at predetermined end time
2. **Proposal Phase**: Anyone can propose an outcome by posting a bond
3. **Challenge Period**: Others can challenge the proposed outcome
4. **Resolution**: Market resolves to final outcome
5. **Distribution**: 
   - Principal returned to all participants
   - Rewards distributed to winning side
